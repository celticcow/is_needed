within the zone code branch:

./extract.py -m <mds> -c <cma> -f <adm_xx_grp.csv> >> zonedata.csv

idea here is to do the following:

take 2 IP addresses in from the user:

extract zone info from zonedata.csv

case 0:
   neither IP is found 
   do nothing and return not able to search
case 1:
   ip1 found / ip2 not found
   do search on policy(s) for ip1 for packet mode search
case 2:
   ip1 not found / ip2 found
   see case 1 :)
case 3: 
   ip1 found / ip 2 found : with having same zone(s) match
   return no firewall crossed
case 4: 
   ip1 found / ip2 found : having different zone(s)
   do packet mode searches for zone iterations
default:
   ????
   profit ?
